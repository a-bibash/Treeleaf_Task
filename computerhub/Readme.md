# Treeleaf Django Qualification Task: Computer Hub Project
## Overview

This project implements a computer hub application using Django, with functionality to manage computer brands, specifications, and inventory. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on computers, with total price calculation based on quantity and unit rate.

## Usage

1. Admin Panel: Access the Django admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin to manage computer brands, specifications, and inventory. (Credentials required)
2. CRUD Operations: Perform CRUD operations on computers using the provided views. Utilize the Django admin panel for CRUD operations on computer brands and specifications.


## Frontend Design

Bootstrap was utilized for frontend design to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## My Approach in Building This Project
### Building the Foundation
I started by creating the necessary models to represent the data structure of the computer hub application. This help me build the foundation for the project, allowing me to visualize how the different components would interact.

### Designing the User Interface
To create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, I decided to use Bootstrap. By utilizing Bootstrap's pre-designed components and responsive grid system, I was able to quickly and efficiently build the basic layout and design elements of the application.

### Implementing CRUD Operations
With the models and UI in place, I turned my attention to implementing the core functionality of the application. I began by defining views to handle the CRUD operations, ensuring create, read, update, and delete operation was seamless.

###Transitioning to Class-Based Views
As the project evolved, I decided to refactor the views to utilize class-based views. This allowed for more organized and efficient code.

### Fine-Tuning and Testing
Throughout the development process, I continuously fine-tuned the codebase, addressing validation errors, fixing bugs, and ensuring the application performed  correctly.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, I've made every effort to accomplish the project's objectives with maximum effectiveness and efficiency.
